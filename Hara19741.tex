\section*{Abstract 摘要}

\begin{paracol}{2}

    The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relation between initial shear modulus and shear strength of cohesive soils. The initial shear moduli were obtained from the results of the well-shooting tests by means of shear waves, while the shear strength could be obtained from the results of laboratory tests conducted on undisturbed soil samples collected at the same site as the well-shooting tests. Taking into consideration the fact that there have been a number of instances where the well-shooting test and the standard penetration test were conducted on the same sites, the authors conducted their research to seek some relationships between the initial shear modulus and the N-value of the standard penetration test, between the shear strength and the N-value, and between the initial shear modulus and the shear strength. The research works have finally led the authors to finding out several relations among initial shear modulus, shear strength and N-value.

    \textbf{Key words: }cohesive soil, elasticity, geophysical exploration, in-situ test, laboratory test, penetration test, shear strength.

    本文的目的是评估黏性土的初始剪切模量与剪切强度之间的关系。 初始剪切模量是通过剪切波从地震测井试验的结果中获得的，而抗剪强度可以从对与地震测井试验在同一地点采集的未扰动土体样品进行的实验室试验结果中获得。 考虑到在许多情况下都在同一地点进行了地震测井试验和标准贯入试验，因此作者进行了研究，以寻求初始剪切模量与标准贯入试验的N值之间，剪切强度与N值之间以及初始剪切模量与剪切强度之间的一些关系。 研究工作最终使作者找到了初始剪切模量，剪切强度和N值之间的几种关系。
